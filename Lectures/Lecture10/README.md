## Assignment â„–7: Parallax Occlusion Mapping

1. Open Scene "Scenes/RunMe"
2. Edit shader vertex and fragment shader in "POM.shader"
3. Implement Normal Mapping. Feel free to refer to [Unity Docs](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SL-VertexFragmentShaderExamples.html). This is not the main goal of the assignment. Make a screenshot of the game view.
4. Implement Bump Mapping. Make a screenshot of the game view.
5. Implement Parallax Occlusion Mapping. Make a screenshot of the view. A simple regular-step version with a linear approximation at the end is enough. Make a screenshot of the game view.
5. Send me your code at mischapanin@gmail.com along with all of your screenshots (at minimum 3).
6. The e-mail should have the following topic: __HSE.CG.<your_name>.<your_last_name>.HW6__

**Bonus points:**   
+10% for soft self-shadowing  
+10% for correct Per-Pixel Depth Offset  
+50% for cone mapping (generate it from the depth map)  

**Hint**  
If you want to spice it up and get a nice animation, generate the height map proceduraly.
